# editgeoc ([modelica](https://modelica.org/))

editgeoc is a command or a script name that is not a standard command or script in most programming languages or operating systems. It seems to be a custom command or script related to editing geographical coordinates.

To provide a conceptual understanding, here's a simple example of how you might implement such a command in a Python script:

```python
def editgeoc(latitude, longitude):
    # Perform any necessary operations to edit the geographical coordinates
    # For example, you could validate the input, update a database, or write to a file
    # Replace the following print statement with your actual implementation
    print(f"Edited geographical coordinates: Latitude: {latitude}, Longitude: {longitude}")
```

# Example usage

editgeoc(40.7128, -74.0060)

In this example, the editgeoc function takes two parameters: latitude and longitude. It performs some operations (in this case, printing the edited coordinates) and then calls the function with example coordinates.

Please note that this is a conceptual example and may not be directly applicable to your use case. You would need to adapt it to your specific requirements and the environment in which it will be used.

    char *input = 0;
    char *output = (char *)malloc(strlen(input) + 1);

    if (output == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    strcpy(output, input);
    printf("Reversed string: %s\n", output);

    free(output);
    return 0;
}
